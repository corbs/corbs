<h6>What’s the difference between a junior designer and a senior?</h6>
Senior designers: Consistent quality, Calm under pressure, Adaptable, Broader Skillset, will stabilize and support a team, and has a strong ability to focus on building a great design rather than making a client happy.<br />
I am a Senior Graphic Designer with many years experience navigating large workloads and challenging environments. I’ve filled many roles within the creative process from web to video, 3D and print. I have a reputation for adapting to the needs of the team, solving problems and distilling information into an accessible format. Pumping out consistent high quality work.
