  <p><strong>What’s the difference between a junior designer and a senior? I mean when it comes down to it really.</strong></p>Senior designers: Consistent quality, Calm under pressure, Adaptable, Broader Skillset, will stabilize and support a team, and has a strong ability to focus on building a great design rather than making a client happy.

  <h1>I’m not a Rockstar or a Ninja</h1>
  <p>If I was to pick a fictional character that best describes myself, I would vehemently insist on being a straight-up Bobba Fett. My certainty in this matter has not been shaken in the slightest by my current design team assuring me I’m pure C3PO.</p>
