  <h1>I’m not a Rockstar or a Ninja</h1>
  <p>If I was to pick a fictional character that best describes myself I would vehemently insist on being a straight-up Bobba Fett. My certainty in this matter has not been shaken in the slightest by my current design team assuring me I’m C3PO.</p>

  <p>In real life I’m a hard working graphic designer with many years experience navigating large workloads and challenging environments. I’ve filled many roles within the creative process and have a deserved reputation for adapting to the needs of the team and pumping out consistent high quality work.  [Download my CV Portfolio]</p>

Over the years I’ve picked up many tips that relate to real world situations. I’ve compiled these and have provided them as free training resources to help along other designers.
