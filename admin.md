<h1>I'm assuming you're interested in this siteâ€™s build system.</h1>
<p>This website was built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github Pages.
Jekyll is a flat file system with no database or front end admin pages.</p>
<strong>Jorbs v0.1</strong>
<p>The theme was created and built by Corbin and the packaged files are available to download and use by anyone.</p>

This is my first time using a flat file syste, so far I've found it to be:
<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Great workflow</li>
<li>Free hosting and development integration via Github</li>
</ul>
